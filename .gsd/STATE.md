# State

## Position

Planning complete — Frontend: Avatar selection step in registration flow

## Decisions

- BountyService.computeRank will be a public method (possibly static) to allow reuse in AuthService without circular dependency
- Keep rank as String (VARCHAR) in DB — no enum migration needed, just store `.name()` of the enum values
- Starting bounty = 1000 (maps to SUPER_ROOKIE/CAPTAIN tier, not ROOKIE/SEAMAN)
- K-factor = 32, bounty floor = 0
- CANCELLED games (game expiration, PLACING_SHIPS surrender) = no bounty change
